/**
 * Autocomplete as you type ("hints")
 *
 * Helps a person quickly enter their full name on a web form or in an application.
 *
 * What it can and can't do
 * - Suggests the full name in one line or separately the last name, first name, patronymic.
 * - Corrects the keyboard layout ("fynjy" â†’ "Anton").
 * - Determines gender.
 *
 * It can't:
 * - Automatically (without human intervention) process the full name from a database or file.
 * - Transliterate (Juliia Somova â†’ Yulia Somova).
 * - Decline by cases (who? to whom? by whom?).
 *
 * @NOTE: Suggestion are not suitable for automatic processing of full names. They offer options, but do not guarantee that they guessed correctly. Therefore, the final decision should always be made by a person.
 *
 * For automatic processing, transliteration and declension by cases, use the Standardization API
