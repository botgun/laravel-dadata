/**
 * Autocomplete as you type ("hints")
 *
 * Helps a person quickly enter an email address on a web form or in an application.
 *
 * What it can and can't do
 * - Suggests the local part (before the "at" sign).
 * - Suggests the domain part (after the "at" sign).
 * - Corrects typos (yadex.ru â†’ yandex.ru).
 *
 * What it can't do:
 * - Automatically (without human intervention) check addresses from a database or file.
 * - Classify addresses as personal (@mail.ru, @yandex.ru), corporate (@myshop.ru) and "role" (info@, support@).
 *
 * Hints are not suitable for automatic email processing. They offer options, but do not guarantee that they have
 * guessed correctly. Therefore, a person should always make the final decision.
